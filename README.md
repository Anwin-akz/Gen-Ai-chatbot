## This Generative AI project represents a leap into how we interact with technology, blending AI's potential with user-friendly interfaces.
 "Riya" is not just a chatbot; it's a leap into the future of human-AI interaction, built using a robust suite of tools including Google Colab, OpenAI, Lang Chain, Gradio, PlayHT, and Hugging Face. These platforms have allowed me to push the boundaries of what's possible, creating a user-friendly and highly adaptable AI assistant.
